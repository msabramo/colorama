
BUGS
----

If not stdout.isatty(), should not issue win32 calls on windows. Unless we're
running under nosetests, in which case stdout is a StringIO, which doesn't
have isatty().

Does not recognise other formats of ANSI sequences. See the wikipedia article
on them, and also the ANSI codes used in Peter Norvig's .pythonstartup.py, at
the bottom of: http://norvig.com/python-iaq.html

fore, back and style should reset to their initial values, not black/white

REFACTOR
--------

stream wrapper should be minimal - other functionality extracted to a new
class

Use distribute instead of distutils

WISHLIST
--------

Make it python3 compatible.

Add support for other ANSI sequences: clear screen, move text cursor.

Figure out why colorama.init() doesn't work for ANSI sequences printed
by the python interactive interpreter. It is using raw_input to print
the prompt. Does that bypass sys.stdout somehow?

Can we make curses work in windows?

Consider whether to scrap support for dim (or bright) in order to use
constant background brightness settings. Make this optional?

Consider whether aspects of demo.py shouldn't be provided by colorama. Eg.
a collection of all foreground colors and names.

Consider replacing our enum classes with something like Norvig's class Struct,
from: http://norvig.com/python-iaq.html, if it can either give us color names
or an easy way to generate 'ALL' collections.
