
BUGS
----

Suspect that it currently does not filter out ansi to redirected streams
when running on linux. Test out whether the shell already does it for us
or something. If not, then we need to wrap and set strip=true when on non-
windows whenever a stream is not a tty. (works ok on windows)

Aha! Current passing of 'stderr=True or False' should be replaced by tri-state,
stderr, stdout or None (some other stream). If None, we do not issue any win32
calls. This path would be used for printing to AnsiToWin32(someotherstream).

Does not recognise or strip other formats of ANSI sequences, ie.single char
sequences, alternative CSI, etc. See the wikipedia article on them, and also
the ANSI codes used in Peter Norvig's .pythonstartup.py, at the bottom of:
http://norvig.com/python-iaq.html - they seem to contain a colon (not
semicolon)

fore, back and style should reset to their initial values, not black/white


REFACTOR
--------

Use distribute instead of distutils

Consider replacing our enum classes with something like Norvig's class Struct,
from: http://norvig.com/python-iaq.html, if it can either give us color names
or an easy way to generate 'ALL' collections.


FEATURES
--------

Add support for other ANSI sequences: clear screen, move text cursor.

Can we make curses work in windows?

Figure out why colorama.init() doesn't work for ANSI sequences printed
by the python interactive interpreter. It is using raw_input to print
the prompt. Does that bypass sys.stdout somehow?

Use bold to represent bright instead? Use fixed (dim) background brightness.

Consider whether aspects of demo.py shouldn't be provided by colorama. Eg.
a collection of all foreground colors and names.
