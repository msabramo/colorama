
tests should not change console color (are ok on ubuntu)

stream wrapper should be minimal - other functionality extracted to new

see Roger thingy's email about only wrapping if isatty()

Make it python3 compatible.

Add other ANSI sequences: clear screen, move text cursor.

There are other formats of ANSI sequences. See the wikipedia article on them,
and also the ANSI codes used in Peter Norvig's .pythonstartup.py, at the bottom
of: http://norvig.com/python-iaq.html

Figure out why colorama.init() doesn't work for ANSI sequences printed
by the python interactive interpreter. It is using raw_input to print
the prompt. Does that bypass sys.stdout somehow?

Can we make curses work windows?

Use distribute instead of distutils

Consider whether aspects of demo.py shouldn't be provided by colorama. Eg.
a collection of all foreground colors and names.

Consider replacing our enum classes with Peter Norvig's class Struct, from:
